    "This dataset measures the genetic and biological effect of BRCA in a cohort of 1000+ patients. \n",

    "For this project we have subset this dataset with common and unique patients across three datasets : \n",

    " - Epigentics (DNAm)\n",
    " - Proteomics (RPPA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction taks in this project is tumour subtype classification. It has been shown that, depending on the specific tumour subtype, outcomes for women with BRCA will vary significantly. Therefore, being able to accruately stratify by subtype is an important characterisation for this cancer and will affect the treatment course decided by the physician. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different subtypes present in this dataset are : \n",
    "- Luminal A (LumA)\n",
    "- Luminal B (LumB)\n",
    "- Basal\n",
    "- HER2\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these modalities will capture a different aspect of the disease, thus many methods which can integrate them have become popular. \n",

    "In this short notebook, we will look at the different data types and give some information on their biological aspects. "
